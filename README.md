# QTIM_loop
Quantum Monte Carlo method for simulating the quantum transverse Ising model (QTIM) at the longitudinal field

The algorithm is based on the recent arXiv paper [Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835)

TIM_TL.jl is the teaching code of simulation of 1-d QTIM with periodic boundary conditions.
